                The frenzy for automatizing each step of the development cycle comes to their biggest
                expression in mobile development. The ability to test any application for each handset or tablet
                is possible without being time consuming. We can even publish our apps without grabbing a mouse
                or keyboard again thanks to with tools as Jenkins, Travis CI, Gitlab CI/CD just to mention a few of
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This post will give a quick start to use Jenkins for android development. I have
                split this tutorial in two parts. The first part will deal with the configuration
                of the Jenkins and the automatization of tests. The second part will deal with
                publishing apps in the play store.

            <h3>
                <b>Installing Jenkins</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                The installation will depend on your operating systems. In <b>windows</b> you usually use <b>docker</b>
                to load the <b>war</b> file for jenkins. You should download <b>Docker Community Edition</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In OSX you can use <b>brew</b> to install jenkins. Since this package comes with <b>Jetty</b>,
                you do not need to install docker.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="bash">
            brew install jenkins
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Then you can start jenkins. I would recommend to use a different port to start the jenkins server,
                since the default port <b>8080</b> is very common for many applications. In windows you must run
            </p>
            <pre><code class="bash">
            java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8080
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                In OSX the command is easier
            </p>
            <pre><code class="bash">
            jenkins --httpPort=4000
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Then you can browse the url <b>http://localhost:4000</b>.
                The first time you must set up your password. The initial password can be found in the secrets folder in
                your jenkins directory. You can also bypass the login if you disable the <b>security</b> property
                in the file <b>./jenkins/config.xml</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The first time you run jenkins the configuration will suggest to install some common plugins.
                After that you will see your dashboard for your jenkins projects.
            <p>

            <h3>
                <b>Installing Plugins</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes you will need additional plugins to run common development tasks. This plugin are used in the
                development
                of java applications, net applications, web applications and many others.
            </p>
            <p>
                To install additional plugins you will need to navigate to <b>http://localhost:4000/pluginManager/</b>
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-plugin.png" type="image/gif">
            <p>
                Some common plugins we use in android development are the following
            <ol>
                <li>Android Emulator</li>
                <li>Android Lint</li>
                <li>Android Signing</li>
                <li>Google Play Android Publisher</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>
                <b>Setting up repositories</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Jenkins will download git repositories and build the application.
                We can achieve this creating a new project in the dashboard.
                You will need to add a <b>new item</b> in the dashboard.
                Then you choose the kind of project you want to set up.
                A <b>Multibranch pipeline</b> will be used if
                you already have a Jenkinsfile with the tasks you will run to build the project.
                We often use a <b>Freestyle project</b> with plugins.
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-jobs.png" type="image/gif">
            <p>
                After selecting a project we must give the git repository in the section <b>Source Code Management</b>.
                You can choose the branch and define further options
                that will be used to compile the project.
                For example sometimes you will be loading submodules.
                Then you must check add <b>Additional Behaviours</b> and for this case we will choose
                <b>Advanced submodule behaviours</b> and check <b>recursively update submodules</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-repos.png" type="image/gif">
            <h3>
                <b>The first build</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                You mostly will build your application with gradle tasks.
                Those tasks can be invoked in a Jenskinsfile or using a plugin such as the <b>Gradle wrapper</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of a Jenkisnfile to compile a binary for debugging is as follows
            </p>
            <pre><code class="jenkins">
            pipeline {
                agent any
                stages {
                    stage('build') {
                        steps {
                            sh './gradlew assembleDebug'
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                You should place this file in the root folder of your project.
                After that you choose this mode in the section <b>Build configuration</b>
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-jenkinsfile.png" type="image/gif">
            <p>
                You can also run gradle tasks using the <b>Gradle wrapper</b>.
                You choose the plugin <b>Invoke gradle script</b> in the section <b>Build</b>.
                Then you shhould add the tasks you want to execute. I will choose <b>assembleDebug</b>
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-gradle.png" type="image/gif">
            <p>
                After the configuration of our build we can run this job in jenkins.
                You just need to click <b>Build now</b> in the left pannel of the dashboard for your project.
                In the section <b>Build history</b> you can observe the last build and
                the dropdown you will see options to know how your job is working.

            <h3>
                <b>The first automatize test</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                You can also do some testing. You just need to add some additional steps to your Jenkinsfile.
                An example of such kind of Jenkinsfile is the next one
            </p>
            <pre><code class="jenkins">
            pipeline {
                agent any
                stages {
                    stage('build') {
                        steps {
                            sh './gradlew assembleDebug'
                            echo 'Building debug apk'
                        }
                    }
                    stage('Test') {
                        steps {
                            echo 'Instrumentation Testing..'
                            sh './gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest'
                            echo 'Unit Testing..'
                            sh './gradlew testDebugUnitTest'
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                As you will have noticed such kind of testing task can be very tedious if you want to do more complex
                testing.
                For example if you want to test for different languages or different screen sizes of a device.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case we have some helpful plugins to make our job easier.
            </p>
            <h3>
                <b>Using Android plugins</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
                We will create a new item or job so we can perform testing on multiple environments.
                Jenkins offers a <b>Multi-configuration project</b> for this kind of situations.
                We configure the project with the git repository and define the branch we want to use.
                This project will have an additional section with the name <b>Configuration matrix</b>.
                We will use this option to define the suite of tests for our application.
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-matrix.png" type="image/gif">
            <p>
                In the section <b>Build environment</b> we check the option <b>Run an Android emulator during build</b>.
                Then we must define the properties of the emulator.
                This option lets you to use the variables of the configuration matrix.
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-emulator.png" type="image/gif">
            <p>
                In the section <b>Build</b> we use the same gradle plugin and add the gradle task for testing.
                In my case I will use <b>connectedDebugAndroidTest</b>.
            </p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/jenkins-buildtest.png" type="image/gif">
            <p>
                After setting up our configuration we can build the job and wait for the result of the test.
                A successful job will be blue in the dashboard and a failure will be red.
            </p>
