            <p>In this tutorial I want to share my list of steps to deploy a django website with amazon web services.
                This will be a brief summary to help you to deploy a python website right away.
                I will also provide some information you will need when you want to manage the database provided for
                AWS.
                Finally I will show how to link your domain to your website with AWS.</p>
            <p>There is a lot of detailed guides which you can find in the documentation offered by AWS.
                In this tutorial I just want to give the basis path to run your website.
                A few steps will require you to do some additional reading and I will provide some useful links in that
                case.</p>
            <p>This tutorial has been structured as follows</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#sec1">Launching an environment with Elastic Beanstalk</a></li>
                <li><a href="#sec2">Setting up AWS CLI and deploying django application</a></li>
                <li><a href="#sec3">Managing PostgreSQL database</a></li>
                <li><a href="#sec4">Setting up domains</a></li>
            </ul>

            <div class="post-subtitle" id="sec1">
                Launching an environment with Elastic Beanstalk
            </div>
            <p>
                From now on, I will assume you have an account in Amazon Web Services and
                you know how to access the management console.
                The first step to deploy a web application is to create the environment where the application will live.
                Elastic Beanstalk lets you to create a virtual machine with Linux as their operative system
                and install the language you require to build your application.
                Since we are creating a Django website I will choose python, in particular the version 2.7.
                You can also run an environment using EC2 instances.
                We start opening the management console and picking <b>Elastic Beanstalk</b> in the top menu.
                You will see the first window of the wizard. This window will show how to start an environment.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/step-01.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md">

            <p>Here we choose the option <b>Web Server Environment</b>.
                Then you will choose the option <b>python language</b> in the next screen.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/step-02.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md">

            <p>Now you will need to give a name to your environment.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/step-03.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md">

            <p>In the following steps you can leave untouched the default configuration.
                When you land in the window shown below, you need to choose your database.
                In my case I will be using a PostgreSQL database.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/step-04.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md"><br />

            <p>Finally you can check your configuration and launch the environment.</p>

            <p>After a successful launching you will redirected to this window</p>

            <div class="post-subtitle" id="sec2">
                Setting up AWS CLI
            </div>
            <p>After creating an environment we can deploy our application.
                AWS has an utility to deploy your websites from the command line.
                This utility is known as <b>awsebcli</b>. You can install this script executing the following command
            </p>
            <pre><code class="bash">pip install awsebcli
</code></pre>
            <p>You can find more details <a
                    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html">here</a>. Now you
                will need to configure the script with your credentials. You can create credentials in the management
                console with the option <b>My Security Credentials</b>. You will find more information in this <a
                    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html">link</a></p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/eb-conf.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md"><br />
            <p>Now you can deploy your python website. Before deploying you will need to create a virtual environment.
                This task is described in this <a
                    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-django.html">link</a>.
                I should mention that we can deploy our website to multiple environments.</p>
            <p>Sometimes we need to create environment variables which are used by our application.
                For instance you might use an environment variable to save the endpoint of your database.
                Environment variables can be created using the management console.
                You must enter your application dashboard and then go to the side menu and choose the option
                <b>Configuration</b>. The you must look for the section <b>Environment Properties</b>.
            </p>

            <div class="post-subtitle" id="sec3">
                Managing PostgreSQL database
            </div>
            <p>A daily task we need to do is maintenance, changing a record, or any kind of operation in a database.
                You might access your database created by AWS using your favourite database manager.
                There exists an utility to manage PostgreSql database with a nice graphical interface.
                This utility is pgAdmin and their last version is 2.0. Before we can use this utility
                we need to allow the access to our database from our computer home.
                You can do that through the management console. This time you must go to <b>VPC Dashboard</b>.
                There you should select the group Id assigned to your RDS database.
                Lastly you should add inbound and outbound rules.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/db-conf-01.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md"><br />
            </p>You must proceed with caution since you can allow access to your database from any computer.
            You should limit the rules to your ip address.</p>
            Then you need to collect some information about your database.
            Information details of your database can be found in your <b>RDS Dashboard</b>.
            You will need endpoint, port, database name, database instance, username and password.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/db-conf-02.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md"><br />
            <p>After collecting these details you can create a server for this database in pgAdmin.
                Firstly you must add a new server</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/pg-admin-01.png' alt=''
                class="blog-image-md"><br />
            <p>Then you will see a window dialog where you will give a name to your server.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/pg-admin-02.png' alt=''
                class="blog-image-md"><br />
            <p>Lastly you must fill the form with the information above.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/pg-admin-03.png' alt=''
                class="blog-image-md"><br />

            <div class="post-subtitle" id="sec3">
                Setting up domains
            </div>
            <p>This the final lap of this long race. After deploying with success your website,
                you might want to use your own domain instead of the awful url assigned by AWS.
                Once you have acquired a domain you can access the management console and link your domain to your
                environment.
                In this case you must go to your <b>Route 53 Dashboard</b>. You can buy a domain here if you do not own
                one.</p>
            <img src='https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/domain-01.png' alt='' class="blog-image-md"><br />
            <p>Then you must go to <b>Hosted Zones</b>. There you can create a type A Record Set which will assign the
                domain to your environment.
                For more information follow this <a
                    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/customdomains.html">link</a>.

            <p>We arrive to the end of this tutorial after walking through different roads.
                Sometimes those roads turn into big mazes where we keep going around without find an escape.
                I hope this tutorial be your breadcrumb trail to put your website online and alive.
