                It might happen to you that you want to know about a location, their surroundings
                and have some glimpse of the activities developing around you.
                In the past you should have carried out books, maps, and brochures.
                In this new century you just have to own a mobile handset
                and you will discover a new world around you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bluetooth is a technology which have been developing during the past decades
                to improve the connectivity and provide new ways to sense our environment.
                Regarding location, bluetooth appliances emits microwaves with a frequency of 2.4 GHz
                that can go through many solid materials like walls, doors (maybe not metal doors), windows, trees
                and reach you mobile device to indicate their existence.
                Hence you can know your position relative to those appliances.
                You can also know your absolute position with GPS but
                they will only work outdoors since radio waves with
                a frequency around of 1 GHz are to weak to come indoors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The easiest way to build this kind of arrangement is using beacons.
                Beacons have an unique identifier which can be used to determine
                the location in the arrangement of beacons spread over any place.
                You can also know how far are you from any beacon with the intensity of the signal.
                It is something like the game of Hunt the Thimble where
                you are closer when it is hotter and you are farther when it is colder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following this line of thought we can imagine a museum or exposition where
                you can find instantly information about a portrait, sculpture or any piece of art.
                You might be in a big theater or arena and find your place with help of your mobile phone.
                You can also be in a forest and identify any flower or tree in that location.
                The most known application of beacons is their use in stores
                to gather information about the behaviour of costumers and offer better deals.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this post I will build a simple app to detect dangerous boxes or equipment in a lab.
                I will assume for our purpose that there is a beacon attached to such equipment.
                So we just need to detect the signal of the beacon and read their intensity.
            </p>

                I will use a common cheap beacon based on Nordic NRF51822 using a 3V coin cell battery CR2032.
                This is a bluetooth module working at low energy and the battery can last for at least one year.
                We consider this beacon as a BLE module since their current is in the range of the microamperes.
                The intensity of the signal used to vanish beyond 60 meters.
                More information about the beacon might be found in their user manual.

                <b>
                    Setting up the project

            </h3>
            <p>
                First of all, you need to grant location and bluetooth permissions to your app.
                Bluetooth low energy will work with Android 4.3 and later versions.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="xml">
            &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
            &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
            &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                In the case of devices with Android Marshmallow and above,
                we need to request permission at runtime. Once we got the permissions
                we can listen to bluetooth devices.
                We might create a service to handle this task.
                In order to detect any bluetooth device we must use the class <b>BluetoothAdapter</b>.
                To get an instance of the <b>BluetoothAdapter</b> we need to invoke the <b>BluetoothManager</b>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="java">
            BluetoothManager bluetoothManager = (BluetoothManager) getSystemService(Context.BLUETOOTH_SERVICE);
            mBluetoothAdapter = bluetoothManager.getAdapter();
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Once we reach the bluetooth manager we can use the <b>BluetoothAdapter</b> to
                detect bluetooth devices. We have two ways to detect devices, the first one use
                a deprecated interface known as <b>LeScanCallback</b> and the second one
                for Lollipop and above use the interface <b>ScanCallback</b>. Both interface will receive
                a response with information about the devices nearby.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us take a look to the class <b>LeScanCallback</b>.
                After starting the scan we receive the name of the device, their MAC address,
                the proximity en decibels and additional information provided by the manufacturer.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="java">
            mBluetoothAdapter.startLeScan(myLeScanCallback);
            ...
            BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback myLeScanCallback = new BluetoothAdapter.LeScanCallback() {
                @Override
                public void onLeScan(BluetoothDevice device, int rssi, byte[] scanRecord) {
                    // Device with name and MAC address
                    // RSSI is the proximity
                    // scanRecord for extra information.
                }
            };
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                For the second case we receive an instance of <b>ScanResult</b> with
                information about the device, the proximity and some extra payload.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="java">
            bluetoothLeScanner.startScan(myScanCallback);
            ...
            ScanCallback myScanCallback = new ScanCallback() {
                @Override
                public void onScanResult(int callbackType, ScanResult result) {
                    super.onScanResult(callbackType, result);
                    int rssi = result.getRssi();
                    BluetoothDevice device = result.getDevice();
                    ScanRecord scanRecord = result.getScanRecord();
                }
            
                @Override
                public void onBatchScanResults(List&lt;ScanResult> results) {
                    super.onBatchScanResults(results);
                }
            
                @Override
                public void onScanFailed(int errorCode) {
                    super.onScanFailed(errorCode);
                }
            };
            </code></pre>
            <h3>
                <b>

            </h3>
            <p>
                Since this app needs to show information regarding how near any visitor is from our lab,
                we will use the <b>RSSI</b> value. The farther we are from the lab the more negative the value becomes.
                Hence the app will have some code as follows
            </p>
            <pre><code class="java">
            if (rssi > -40){
                Log.d("MyApp","Your life is in danger!");
            } else if (rssi > -70) {
                Log.d("MyApp","Too close!");
            } else {
                Log.d("MyApp","Please stay away!!!");
            }

            <p>
                Some bluetooth devices offers real time information about power, proximity,
                hearth rate, speed, temperature, pressure, humidity. You can get this information
                connecting to the GATT service of the devices. Each GATT service have assigned an UUID identifier.
                UUID identifiers are like IP addresses which we might use to connect to the server supplying
                a well defined information about the device.
            </p>
