            <p>
                One of the most important tools helping many developers to remove issues and bugs in the code
                is the debugger.
            </p>
            <p>In this short post I will spend some lines explaining how to use this fab tool in Android Studio.</p>
            <h3><u>Start the debugger</u></h3>
            <p>You can access the debugger through the <b>Run</b> menu, choosing the option <b>Debug</b>.
                The debugger is also available in the toolbar, you will notice a bug with a small triangle.
                The other way to launch the debugger is using the shortcut keys <b>SHIFT + F9</b>.</p>
            <p>This will bind the debugger while launching the application.
                Then a new <b>Debug</b> tab will appear at the bottom of the IDE.
                You will notice the window tab is split in two panels. The left panel contains the running processes.
                The right panel contains variable of the code that you are tracking.</p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/debug-panels.png" type="image/png">
            <p>If you miss to start the debugger after launching your application you should read the next section.</p>
            <h3><u>Attach the debugger to process</u></h3>
            <p>You still can attach the debugger after launching your application.
                You need to look for the option <b>Attach to local process...</b> in the menu <b>Run</b>.
                There is an quick access to this option by clicking the icon with a phone and a bug in the toolbar.
                Then you will see a small window where you must choose the process started by your application.
                The process has tje same name of the application package.</p>

            <h3><u>Controlling the debugger</u></h3>
            <p>After binding your application to the debugger you can explore the internal workings of your code
                by setting breakpoint in your code. Breakpoint are usually added to the lines of your code doing
                a double click at the left side of the editor next to the column number.
                You can also add a breakpoint by placing the cursor
                at the line to be analyzed. The shortcut keys <b>CTRL + F8</b> can do the job too.
                You can jump from a breakpoint to another one using the Resume icon
                in the window debug or by using the hotkey <b>F9</b>.</p>
            <p>You can get a list of all the breakpoints in the project when
                you expand the tab <b>Favorites</b> at the left side of the IDE. This panel will appear
                below the panel project.</p>

            <p>There is also possible to visualize a sorted list of breakpoint
                with the option <b>View Breakpoints...</b> in the <b>Run</b> menu.</p>

            <h3><u>Watching variables</u></h3>
            <p>Sometimes you will need to keep a track of internal fields or variables of the instances created by our
                applications.
                This variables are usually not explicit in the code and you can assign a breakpoint.
                You still can watch to this implicit variables using the feature <b>New watch...</b>.
                This option can be accessed by doing double click in the panel of variables or clicking the
                sunglass icon. Then you can choose the variable you want to analyze.</p>

            <h3><u>Change values</u></h3>
            <p>It is possible to change the values of the variables at runtime. This feature will let you
                to test in-flight different scenarios for you application. This option can be enabled with
                the hotkey <b>F2</b>. Another way to change a variable is with the option <b>Evaluate Expression...</b>.
                This option is accessible with the shortcut keys <b>ALT + F8</b> or in the <b>Run</b> menu.</p>
