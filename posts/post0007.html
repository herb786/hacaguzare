            <p>
                During the developing cycle of an application we need to take different decisions to
                fulfill all the requirements of a project. Sometimes we need to take decisions involving
                the visual aspect of the application. We need to choose the right size for an icon, the right type of an
                image,
                their color properties, the dimension of the fonts, the units which we should use.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are very general rules about which units we might use for the fonts in an Android application.
                The question is whether we must take these rules as the bible to generate every screen in an
                Android application or we can have a voice and ignore these rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes it is very difficult to go against the common agreement, but I think
                it is most important the user experience we are bringing to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this post, I want to present the case of using scalable fonts in Android applications.
                As you must know the developer guide says to always use scalable fonts. Maybe
                this is an overstatement, however I will present two cases where it would better
                to use our judgement instead of following "the good practices".
            </p>
            <p>
                We will see the case of using scalable fonts in an advertisement for a new deal and
                the case of using them in an information page.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, I want to show how the screens will look we the common unit used in
                android applications, that is, density pixel units.
            </p>

                This will work for any user unless he or she has impaired vision. In this case the user will
                probably change their settings and choose a bigger font.
            </p>

            <p>This change will not have any effect in our application since we are using density pixels and
                the font will stay the same.</p>
            <p>If we follow the recommendation of the developer guide and we use scalable pixel units, then
                we find that the size of the text in the application will adapt to the user preferred size.</p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/device-2018-04-09-sp.gif" type="image/gif">
            <p>As you can see, the information page will complete its goal of bringing information
                to the users. However the advertisement will lost their visual content embedded on each element of
                design
                as the size, shape, aligment and position.</p>
            <p>We can deal with this issue in a solomonic way. We can use density pixel units for the advertisement
                and scalable pixel units for the information page.</p>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/py4hacaller/device-2018-04-09-good.gif" type="image/gif">
            <p>Since some developers are not familiar with the graphic arts, they will prefer to gain textual content
                at expenses of visual content. The other side of the coin is that you could never give
                a text huge enough to please some users.</p>
